    Sometimes it is not possible two differentiate two closely related amino acids, therefore we have the special cases: 
    
    asparagine/aspartic acid - asx - B
    glutamine/glutamic acid - glx - Z

    Uncommon amino acids

In addition to the 20 common amino acids, there are two non standard, or non-canonical amino acids found in nature, 
selenocysteine (Sec or U) present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, and pyrrolysine (Pyl or O), found 
in some archaea and one bacterium. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded by variant codons.

Uncommon amino acids also have three-letter codes and when in sequences may be represented by the one-letter symbol X, 
with an explanation accompanying it. The list below is the abbreviations for the uncommon amino acids used throughout 
our website and literature.....
